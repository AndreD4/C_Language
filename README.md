# Compiler Errors

* Programming Language have rules.

* Syntax errors - something wrong with the structure

// std::cout << " Errors << std::endl;

return 0

* Semantic errors - something wrong with the meaning

// a + b    when it doesn't make sense to add (a) and (b).

# Complier Warnings 
Do NOT ignore them!

* The compiler has recognized an issue with your code that could lead to a potential problem.

* It's only a warning because the compiler is still able to generate the correct machine code.

int miles_driven;

  std::cout << miles_driven:

 * Warning: 'miles_driven' is used uninitialized ...

# linker Errors

* The linker is having trouble linking all the objects files together to create an executable.

* Usually there is a library or object file that is missing.
